## Azure Data Factory Use Cases

After an in-depth review of ADF’s features and components, let’s see what we could use it for. 

### 1. Data migration
ADF is a powerful tool for migrating data from on-premises systems to cloud-based platforms. It simplifies complex migrations by automating data movement, ensuring data integrity, and minimizing downtime. ADF ensures a secure and efficient migration process, accommodating both structured and unstructured data.

### 2. ETL for data warehousing
Extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes are at the heart of modern data warehousing. Azure Data Factory streamlines these workflows by integrating data from multiple sources, applying transformation logic, and loading it into a data warehouse.
