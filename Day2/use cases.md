# Azure Data Factory Use Cases

After an in-depth review of ADF’s features and components, let’s see what we could use it for. 

## 1. Data migration
ADF is a powerful tool for migrating data from on-premises systems to cloud-based platforms. It simplifies complex migrations by automating data movement, ensuring data integrity, and minimizing downtime. 

For instance, you can use ADF to migrate data from an on-premises SQL Server to an Azure SQL Database with minimal manual intervention. By leveraging built-in connectors and integration runtimes, ADF ensures a secure and efficient migration process, accommodating both structured and unstructured data.

## 2. ETL for data warehousing
Extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes are at the heart of modern data warehousing. Azure Data Factory streamlines these workflows by integrating data from multiple sources, applying transformation logic, and loading it into a data warehouse. 

For example, ADF can consolidate sales data from different regions, transform it into a unified format, and load it into Azure Synapse Analytics. This streamlined process enables you to maintain up-to-date, high-quality data for reporting and decision-making.

## 3. Data integration for data lakes
Data lakes serve as a central repository for diverse datasets, enabling advanced analytics and machine learning. ADF facilitates ingesting data from various sources into Azure Data Lake Storage, supporting batch and streaming scenarios. 

For instance, you can use ADF to collect log files, social media feeds, and IoT sensor data into a single data lake. By providing data transformation and integration tools, ADF ensures the data lake is well-organized and ready for downstream analytics and AI workloads.
