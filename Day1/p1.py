## what is Azure Data Factory?

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service designed to orchestrate and automate data workflows. 
It is used to collect, transform, and deliver data, ensuring that insights are readily accessible for analytics and decision-making. 
With its scalable and serverless architecture, ADF can handle workflows of any sizeâ€”from simple data migrations to complex data transformation pipelines.
ADF bridges the gap between data silos, enabling users to move and transform data between on-premises systems, cloud services, and external platforms.
