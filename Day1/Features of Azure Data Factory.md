## what is Azure Data factory ?

Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud-based data integration service designed to orchestrate and automate data workflows. 
It is used to collect, transform, and deliver data, ensuring that insights are readily accessible for analytics and decision-making. 
With its scalable and serverless architecture, ADF can handle workflows of any size—from simple data migrations to complex data transformation pipelines.
ADF bridges the gap between data silos, enabling users to move and transform data between on-premises systems, cloud services, and external platforms. 

## Features of Azure Data Factory

 ### 1.Data integration:
Azure Data Factory supports integration with over 90 data sources, including cloud-based and on-premises systems. It includes support for SQL databases, NoSQL systems, REST APIs, and file-based data sources, allowing you to unify data workflows regardless of the source or format.

### 2.No-code pipeline authoring:
ADF’s drag-and-drop interface simplifies how users create data pipelines. With prebuilt templates, guided configuration wizards, and an intuitive visual editor, even users with no coding expertise can design comprehensive end-to-end workflows. 

### 3.Scheduling:
Azure Data Factory’s scheduling tools offer workflow automation. Users can set up triggers based on specific conditions, such as a file’s arrival in cloud storage or scheduled time intervals. These scheduling options eliminate the need for manual interventions and ensure workflows are executed consistently and reliably.
