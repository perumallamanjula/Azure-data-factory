# Best Practices for Using Azure Data Factory
Lastly, itâ€™s worth reviewing some best practices for using ADF effectively.

## 1. Modular pipeline design
To create maintainable and scalable workflows, design pipelines with reusable components. Modular design allows for easier debugging, testing, and updating of individual pipeline sections. For example, instead of embedding data transformation logic in every pipeline, create a reusable pipeline that can be invoked across multiple workflows. This reduces redundancy and enhances consistency across projects.

## 2. Optimize data movement

**Use compression:** To minimize data transfer times and reduce network bandwidth usage, compress large datasets before moving them. For instance, using gzip or similar methods can significantly speed up the movement of large files.

**Select the right integration runtime:** The choice of integration runtime (Azure IR, Self-hosted IR, or SSIS IR) is critical in optimizing performance. For example, self-hosted IR can be used for on-premises data movement to ensure secure and efficient transfers, while Azure IR is ideal for cloud-native operations.

# 3. Implement robust error handling

**Retry policies:** Configure retry policies for transient errors, such as temporary network disruptions or server timeouts. This ensures pipelines can recover and complete successfully without manual intervention.

**Set up alerts:** Implement alerts and notifications to proactively inform your team of pipeline failures or performance issues. Use tools like Azure Monitor to configure custom alerts based on specific error types or execution delays, ensuring quick resolution and minimal downtime.
